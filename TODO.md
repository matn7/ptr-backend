- Reduce size of pandatronik_ui image, probably remove nodes_module
- manage somehow ddl-auto:create validate to not recreate DB every time?
- Notification does not come from backend to ui (for instance for user registration yellow window)
- insert ROLES and PLAN during container startup (test with manually added data)
